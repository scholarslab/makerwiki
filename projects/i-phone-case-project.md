# Inspirations
I worked in AC/refrigeration in the summer of 2016 and I noticed that there was one tool we used a lot, the hex wrench. At almost every job site, the first thing we would pull out is the 5/16" or the 1/4" hex wrench. So, I thought I would add our most used tools to my most used tool, my phone.

# Early Attempts
Early versions of this project are fairly crude and simple. I essentially taught myself how to use Autodesk Inventor over the course of this project, as I had only ever used Autodesk AutoCAD up to this point. I learned that I could get a free educational license through my school and set myself the goal of making my own iPhone case. Below is an example of the first version of this design.
