# Inspirations
I worked in AC/refrigeration in the summer of 2016 and I noticed that there was one tool we used a lot, the hex wrench. At almost every job site, the first thing we would pull out is the 5/16" or the 1/4" hex wrench. So, I thought I would add our most used tools to my most used tool, my phone. My original ideas featured the hex sockets in two places. One set at the bottom of the phone, so that you can use the full phone like a handle, and one in the center of the phone case, so that you can turn the bolt quickly from that point. Like this.

I worked from these iPhone 6 schematics as a reference for my phone.

# Early Attempts
Early versions of this project are fairly crude and simple. I essentially taught myself how to use Autodesk Inventor over the course of this project, as I had only ever used Autodesk AutoCAD up to this point. I learned that I could get a free educational license through my school and set myself the goal of making my own iPhone case. Over time, I continued to scrap, learn, and reiterate the design until I got something workable. Old poor versions of this project can be seen on [my Thingiverse Page](https://www.thingiverse.com/Rubiks_Cubist/designs).  This process continued until I got something that I liked.

This was my first functional prototype. I implemented 3 different Hex sizes, 5/16", 1/4", and 3/8". This gives me a small range of tools to work with.
