# Inspirations
I worked in AC/refrigeration in the summer of 2016 and I noticed that there was one tool we used a lot, the hex wrench. At almost every job site, the first thing we would pull out is the 5/16" or the 1/4" hex wrench. So, I thought I would add our most used tools to my most used tool, my phone. My original ideas featured the hex sockets in two places. One set at the bottom of the phone, so that you can use the full phone like a handle, and one in the center of the phone case, so that you can turn the bolt quickly from that point. Like this.

I worked from these iPhone 6 schematics as a reference for my phone.

# Early Attempts
Early versions of this project are fairly crude and simple. I essentially taught myself how to use Autodesk Inventor over the course of this project, as I had only ever used Autodesk AutoCAD up to this point. I learned that I could get a free educational license through my school and set myself the goal of making my own iPhone case. Over time, I continued to scrap, learn, and reiterate the design until I got something workable. Old poor versions of this project can be seen on [my Thingiverse Page](https://www.thingiverse.com/Rubiks_Cubist/designs).  This process continued until I got something that I liked.

This was my first functional prototype. I implemented 3 different Hex sizes, 5/16", 1/4", and 3/8". This gives me a small range of tools to work with. As you can see, there is a small lip running around the inside edge of the case. This is to keep the case attached to the phone, as the inner width is exactly the width of the phone. There is a divot that runs along the width of the case, this was intended to make it a little easier to place and remove the case on/from the phone. It is supposed to make it a little bendy, but not so much that it compromises the integrity of the design. At this point in the process, I intended to get this made out of metal, as I figured that plastic would simply be too soft/weak for the design to function properly (which it is). 
# Big Changes
After the previous iteration, I learned several facts that influenced my design moving forward. 
1. You cannot cover a phone in metal or it will completely ruin the cell signal.

This fact is something I gleaned from the schematics after having stared at them for hours on end. It seems obvious, but it did not occur to me at the time. The most vulnerable sections of the phone to this phenomenon are the top and bottom 10%. Presumably, this is where the actual communication is taking place and cannot be blocked by metal. 

2. The TAZ5 in the Makerspace can print in a flexible filament

This fact, combined with traditional phone case designs, inspired all of my future iterations. Traditionally, phone cases are 2-material designs. One particular trend-setter for this is Otterbox. There is the soft, rubbery casing which provides shock absorbance, and then the hard casing to hold everything together and prevent scratching. I figured, why not try it? And so I set off down this new path of design. By this point, I was getting pretty good at making iPhone cases, so making the next iteration didnt actually take that long. However, it did open my eyes to a new feature of Autodesk Inventor, Assemblies.

# A Two-Part Design
The final design is shown below.

![Phone Case Full Front View](/uploads/i-phone-case-project/phone-case-full-front-view.png "Phone Case Full Front View")
![Phone Case Full Rear View](/uploads/i-phone-case-project/phone-case-full-rear-view.png "Phone Case Full Rear View")

Because the top and bottom couldn't be covered in metal, I decided to move the actual hex parts to the side portions of the back face, and have a flexible part holding the hold thing to the iPhone.  There is a lip along the inside edge of the red bit that allows it to hold on to the iPhone itself. I also added tick marks to the side profile so that the alignment/position of the hex sockets even when the holes are not visible (i.e., when the phone is sitting flush on a surface). The red part is intended to be printed in a flexible, but strong, rubbery material. It needed to be flexible to reduce the shock impact of when I drop my phone on the floor, flexible so that it could be easily added, strong so that it would not fall off the phone unless I intended it to. Armed with this design, I started 3D printing.

# 3D Printing
It also happened that this project ended up being a big learning experience into the world of 3D printers. I decided to print the outer casing in a variety of materials and see which one would function the best. 

## Good ol' PLA
![Gray Pla](/uploads/i-phone-case-project/gray-pla.jpg "Gray Pla")

This gray PLA was to act as a kind of "baseline" for all future materials I tested. I learned in the previous one-piece designs that PLA is fairly brittle under impact, as I dropped my phone on concrete and a small portion of the corner of the case chipped off. It did its job, my phone was perfectly fine. And I learned something that I was able to apply later. At this time, I did not have the other portion of the case printed, so this was the only part I had. However, this piece alone functioned decently well as a phone case. It protects the corners, and it is actually quite minimalist to look at. The nice gray provides a good complement to the cool aluminum iPhone shell. 

## Ninjaflex

The Ninjatek Ninjaflex is the most elastic of the Flex materials, and provides a lot of stretch, particularly for low infils. However, it simply was not stiff enough to hold onto the phone without the phone falling out. While I think this material might be the best for shock absorbance, it was just too weak with this system of holding onto the phone to be useful. 

## Semiflex, ding, ding ding!
![White Semi Flex](/uploads/i-phone-case-project/white-semi-flex.jpg "White Semi Flex")

The Ninjatek Ninjaflex turned out to be the perfect material for my specifcations. While not as stretchy or elastic as the Ninjaflex, it had the requisite strength to hold the inner core onto the phone without the whole thing falling apart. Also, the soft rubbery-ness makes it easy to put on and take off. 

## Comparing the 3 Materials.

Here is a quick visual guide to the 3 materials tested for this project.
