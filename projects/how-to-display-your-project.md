# How to display your project
## A Quick Note
This is a brief guide on how you might display your project here on the Makerspace Wiki! Remember, *these are just guidelines*. Feel free to include whatever information you would like and tell us as much or as little as you are willing. This is a place for others to come and be inspired! Did your project not turn out like you wanted? No problem! Tell us why it went wrong. Is the project incomplete? Don't worry! It might be a great starting point for someone else to come pick up where you left off!

## The Actual Guide
### Helpful things to include!
* Your name
* Some contact info (email, phone #, etc.)
* Level of Completion (in progress? complete?)
* The Goal! (A finished product? A basic protoype?)
* What technologies you used to accomplish your project (3D Printing, Arduino, etc.)
* Are you seeking help on the project if it is ongoing? 

### Fill in the details!
Tell a story with your project. What was your inspiration? Did it turn out the way you expected? What mistakes did you learn along the way?
### Seriously, lots of detail!
Give as much info as you can (and are willing) to give on the project. A truly interesting project will allow the reader to understand your sense of accomplishment. Put in progress pictures, show the code you wrote, show all the failed versions. This kind of experimentation and documentation is amazingly helpful to others who might have a similar idea to yours.
