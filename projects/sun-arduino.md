# Inspirations!
This project was brought to me by Dan Foulds, a good friend (and DM!) of mine. He wanted to create a small model of the Sun that could be used in for Dungeons and Dragons for our game. But, he also wanted it to have several cool light patterns that would correlate to different situations in the game. Essentially, he had this idea and wanted me to help him make it real. The goal: A 3D printed, LED-filled, controllable, independently powered model of the Sun.
# First steps!
The first challenge was finding a model of the sun. We wanted it to have the correct "look". As in, it had to be kinda bumpy and have the correct topography to emulate the Sun properly. We ended up going with a [Moon model from Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2344879). (I'll use we in this guide, but really I mean Dan would tell me what he wanted and I would do the work.)

Once we settled on the moon model, I cut it up in Meshmixer, hollowing it out so that we could put lights on the inside and cutting a lid onto it so that we could insert the lights and then glue it shut. (put our models on Thingiverse and link them here)

# Now the hard part...

# TO DO
Upload models on Thingiverse, post many pictures, post code, etc.
