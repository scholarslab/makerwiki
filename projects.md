# Why This Is Here
This is a place to be inspired. Come and view the projects that other people have completed (or not!) in the Scholars' Lab Makerspace! 
# How to display your project
This is a brief guide on how you might display your project here on the Makerspace Wiki! Remember, *these are just guidelines*. Feel free to include whatever information you would like and tell us as much or as little as you are willing. This is a place for others to come and be inspired! Did your project not turn out like you wanted? No problem! Tell us why it went wrong. Is the project incomplete? Don't worry! It might be a great starting point for someone else to come pick up where you left off!
