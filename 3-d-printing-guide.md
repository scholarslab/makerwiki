# Why this is here
This guide is here to provide an eternal resource for Technologists of the Makerspace. The biggest challenge about jumping into a job like this is all the new information. Working at the Makerspace is truly a learning experience, so we wanted to share our insights and tips on how to use the tools in the Makerspace effectively. A lot of times, we will make decisions based on intuition, and this guide is here to give you a basic sense of what that intuition looks like. Happy printing!
