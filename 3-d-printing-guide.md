<!-- SUBTITLE: A comprehensive tutorial on 3D printing, adapted from the "Technologist Training" document, written by Nicolas Dalton  -->

# Why this is here
This guide is here to provide an eternal resource for Technologists of the Makerspace. The biggest challenge about jumping into a job like this is all the new information. Working at the Makerspace is truly a learning experience, so we wanted to share our insights and tips on how to use the tools in the Makerspace effectively. A lot of times, we will make decisions based on intuition, and this guide is here to give you a basic sense of what that intuition looks like. Happy printing!

# Choosing a Printer
# Using Slicers
## Choosing a slicer
Choosing a slicing software to use mostly comes down to what printer you would like to use. You can slice for any of the printers in the Makerspace using Simplify 3D on the PC. 

If you are using the TAZ, you can also choose to use Cura Lulz on either desktop
If you are using the Ultimaker, you can use Cura, Cura Lulz, or Simplify3D.
	Note that vanilla Cura is a little clunky and can be hard to use.
If you are using the Makerbot Replicator, you must use Simplify 3D on the PC!
* Use the "The Doge" profile. It is customized for our printer. Also, remember not to hit save after you are finished slicing a particular object, as this overrides the default printing profiles.

## Slicing Settings
The most important settings that control the quality of your print are
* Layer Height
* Percent Infill
* Number of Shells
* Rafting
* Brimming/Skirting
